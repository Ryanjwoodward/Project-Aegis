# Project Aegis

***
Project Aegis is a simple inventory management system meant to be installed on a Raspberry PI. It leverages **Python**, **Flask**,**SQlite**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Aegis allows you to _check out_ items from an inventory and will inform the user when an item is outside its return due date. Items can easily be edited, removed, or added to the inventory. The user can seamlessly high/show the three panels _complete inventory_, _item actions (i.e. create, update, delete)_, and _late items_. In order to get Aegis up and running a user would only have to ensure Python, Flask, and SQLite are installed then they could get the system up and running by executing the main Python script.
